1. Any nonregular fraction `m/n` is periodic, and has a period `lambda(n)` independent of `m`, which is **at most `n-1`** digits long. If `n` is relatively prime to 10, then the period `lambda(n)` of `m/n` is a divisor of `phi(n)` and has at most `phi(n)` digits, where `phi` is the totient function. It turns out that `lambda(n)` is the *multiplicative order* of 10 (mod `n`) (Glaisher 1878, Lehmer 1941). The number of digits in the repeating portion of the decimal expansion of a rational number can als obe found directly from the multiplicative order of its denominator.

>* Using idea: number of repeating digits at most as great as `n-1`
